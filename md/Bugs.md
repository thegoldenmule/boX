#Bugs

Find a bug? I don't believe it! But just to appease you all, please follow the below guidelines in submitting a bug:

* Try searching the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegoldenmule/box/issues) to see if this bug has already been reported. If it has, provide any additional information you may have.
* If the bug doesn't already exist, create an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thegoldenmule/box/issues).
* Specify the version number and timestamp of the build you are using. The timestamp can be found in the global variable `__buildTimestamp`.
* Include as much information as you can about your browser, OS and graphics card.
* Describe three pieces of information: reproduction steps, resulting outcome, and expected outcome.

#### Bonus Points (not required)

* Provide a link to a live application or a test case that reproduces the bug ([JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) is a great way to do this).
* Include an annotated screenshot. These are super helpful.
* Include the logs from your browser's javascript console.
