# Contribute

bo-X is looking for contributions in all forms.

### What Can I Contribute?

In short: anything and everything. Perhaps the most meaningful contribution you could make to the project is to __simply use bo-X__. Once you do, let us know what you think.

Here are a few concrete suggestions for contributions once you've given bo-X a shot:

* __Code review__. If you love reading code, why not give bo-X a read? Give comments, suggestions: what are we doing right? What are we doing wrong?

* __Architecture review__. Maybe you don't like the nitty gritty and that's okay, because we'd love your input on architecture. bo-X is modeled after many existing engines: Flash, Unity, Cocos2d, THREE, etc, but we're not happy being on par with the big guys, we'd like to be better. Maybe these architectures repulse you? Let use know.

* __Submit bugs__. Use [GitHub's fancy issue tracker](https://github.com/thegoldenmule/box/issues) and try to follow the [guidelines for submitting bugs](https://github.com/thegoldenmule/boX/blob/master/md/Bugs.md).

* __Pull requests__. That's why it's on GitHub, my friends: because we love pull requests. The includes everything from one line bug fixes to brand-spankin new features. If you have sweeping architectural changes, well let's talk about it before you get to deep.

* __Unit tests__. If you spot a fragile bit of code, consider writing up a unit test. Tests are located in the tests folder, and leverage the [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) library.

* __Demos__. Have you written something with bo-x that you'd like to share? We're all ears. Anything that shows off what bo-X can do.

* __Art__. Do you have a knack for logos? Or maybe you just have some art that would look great in a demo? Whatever you have, send it our way, we'd love to get in touch.

* __Documentation__. Our documentation is incomplete. What's more, it needs updated constantly. If you see something amiss, let us know, or fix it yourself and create a pull request. Write up an article on how to do something cool or how to use a specific part of bo-X.

### Did We Miss Anything?

Seriously, we need your contributions. The above list is only a suggestion. If you have something else to offer, something we haven't thought of, send it our way!
