## boX - WebGL-Powered 2D Engine
boX (bo-chi) is a flexible, high-performance 2D rendering engine built on WebGL.

## Features

## Usage

## This reminds me of something...
Is it Unity? Flash? Starling? Cocos-2d? THREE.js? Yup. There's a little bit of everything in boX, and hopefully some
stuff you've never seen before. The easy of Unity without the burden of a black-boxed renderer or scene graph. The
familiar API of Flash or Starling without the stupidity (and with loads more performance). The mechanical preciseness of
 Cocos2d without the unbe-bloody-lievably horrible usability. To top it all off, that certain JavaScript grace and
 sophistication of THREE.js.

## Motivation
When I started writing this, I didn't see any existing WebGL powered 2D engines, so I decided to make one.
